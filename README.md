### Face Mask Detection - Output Screenshot

This project includes a **Face Mask Detection System** that uses a pre-trained model to identify whether individuals in an image are wearing a mask or not. The detection results are visually represented by bounding boxes with labels:

- **Green Bounding Boxes**: Indicate that a mask is detected on the individual.
- **Red Bounding Boxes**: Indicate that no mask is detected.
